An interactive Excel dashboard that brings hundreds of fortune cookie messages to life using Power Query, VBA macros, and creative design.

## 💡 Inspiration

This project was born out of a habit I didn’t realize I had — collecting fortune cookie messages. When I moved out of my college apartment recently, I found an embarrassing number of them taped to my walls, tucked in drawers, and even scattered around my desk. Most were mine, but I had also started collecting my friends’ fortunes anytime we ate together.

As I looked at the pile, I thought: *“What if I actually analyzed these?”* That turned into this playful but data-driven dashboard.

## 🧠 VBA Interactivity

Using shape layering and the Selection Pane, I created a reveal sequence where clicking a fortune cookie image shows a message and then displays the full dashboard.

## 📦 Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains 500 fictional fortune cookie messages along with associated themes, subthemes, source restaurants, and locations. Since no public dataset like this exists, the messages were generated using GitHub Copilot based on real-world formatting patterns and tone.

The goal was to create a realistic, structured sample to showcase data cleaning, categorization, and interactive dashboard design in Excel — not to conduct an academic linguistic study.

➡️ This dataset simulates what you'd get from compiling messages over time from various restaurants and regions.
