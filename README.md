> **Click the cookie. Reveal your fortune. Analyze the trends.**

An interactive Excel dashboard that blends whimsy with data — built around a personal habit of collecting fortune cookie messages. This project uses VBA, Power Query, and classic Excel visuals to bring hundreds of tiny predictions to life.

## 💡 Inspiration

This project was born out of a habit I didn’t realize I had — collecting fortune cookie messages. When I moved out of my college apartment recently, I found an embarrassing number of them taped to my walls, tucked in drawers, and even scattered around my desk. Most were my own, but I also started collecting my friends’ fortunes anytime we ate together.

As I looked at the pile, I thought: “What if I actually analyzed these?” That question turned into this interactive Excel dashboard — a way to explore the themes, and trends hidden inside hundreds of tiny paper predictions.
